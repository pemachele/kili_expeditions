                        <p> is a dormant volcano in Tanzania. It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. It
                            is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain in the
                            world: 5,895 metres (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 metres (16,100 ft) above its
                            plateau base.
                            There are seven established routes to climb Mount Kilimanjaro - Marangu, Machame, Lemosho,
                            Shira, Rongai, Northern Circuit and Umbwe. The Marangu, Machame, and Umbwe routes all
                            approach from the south of the mountain (Mweka is used only for descent). The Lemosho, Shira
                            and Northern Circuit routes approach from the west. The Rongai route approaches from the
                            north.

                                                MACHAME ROUTE  7 DAYS, 6 NIGHT’S
DAY 0:
Arrive Kilimanjaro International Airport, where you will meet by our company representative and transferred to your hotel in Moshi. Evening briefing at hotel to prepare you for the climb ahead, followed by group dinner, an opportunity for the group to get to know each other before the climb.
•	Six-day option available
•	No hut required.
•	Camping accommodation available at all camps.
DAY 1
•	Machame Gate to Machame Camp
•	Elevation (ft): 5,400ft to 9,400ft
•	Distance: 11 km
•	Hiking Time: 5-7 hours
•	Habitat: Rain Forest
The drive from Moshi to the Mount Kilimanjaro National Park Gate takes about 50 minutes. The journey passes through the village of Machame which is located on the lower slopes of the mountain.
We now leave the park gate and walk through the rain forest on a winding trail up a ridge. Lower down, the trail can be muddy and slippery. Gaiters and trekking poles are a good idea here. We continue a short distance until we reach the Machame Camp.
DAY 2
•	Machame Camp to Shira Camp
•	Elevation (ft): 9,400ft to 12,500ft
•	Distance: 5 km
•	Hiking Time: 4-6 hours
•	Habitat: Moorland
After breakfast, we leave the glades of the rain forest and continue on an ascending path, crossing the little valley walking along a steep rocky ridge, covered with heather, until the ridge ends. The route now turns west onto a river gorge. Time for rest, dinner, and overnight at the Shira campsite.
DAY 3
•	Shira Camp to Lava Tower to Barranco Camp
•	Elevation (ft): 12,500ft to 13,000ft
•	Distance: 10 km
•	Hiking Time: 6-8 hours
•	Habitat: Semi Desert
From the Shira Plateau, we continue to the east up a ridge, passing the junction towards the peak of Kibo. As we continue, our direction changes to the South East towards the Lava Tower, called the "Shark's Tooth." Shortly after the tower, we come to the second junction which brings us up to the Arrow Glacier at an altitude of 16,000ft. We now continue down to the Barranco Hut at an altitude of 13,000ft. Here we rest, enjoy dinner, and overnight. Although you end the day at the same elevation as when you started, this day is very important for acclimatization and will help your body prepare for summit day.
DAY 4
•	Barranco Camp to Karanga Camp
•	Elevation (ft): 13,000ft to 13,100ft
•	Distance: 5 km
•	Hiking Time: 4-5 hours
•	Habitat: Alpine Desert
After breakfast, we leave Barranco and continue on a steep ridge passing the Barranco Wall, to the Karanga Valley campsite. This is a short day meant for acclimatization.
DAY 5
•	Karanga Camp to Barafu Camp
•	Elevation (ft): 13,100ft to 15,300ft
•	Distance: 4 km
•	Hiking Time: 4-5 hours
•	Habitat: Alpine Desert
After breakfast, we leave Karanga and hit the junction which connects with the Mweka Trail. We continue up to the Barafu Hut. At this point, you have completed the South Circuit, which offers views of the summit from many different angles. Here we make camp, rest, enjoy dinner, and prepare for the summit day. The two peaks of Mawenzi and Kibo are to be seen from this position.
DAY 6
•	Barafu Camp to Summit to Mweka Hut
•	Elevation (ft): 15,300ft to 19,345ft (and down to 10,000ft)
•	Distance: 5 km ascent / 12 km descent
•	Hiking Time: 7-8 hours ascent / 4-6 hours descent
•	Habitat: Arctic
Very early in the morning (midnight to 2am), we continue our way to the summit between the Rebmann and Ratzel glaciers. You head in a northwesterly direction and ascend through heavy scree towards Stella Point on the crater rim. This is the most mentally and physically challenging portion of the trek.
At Stella Point (18,600 ft), you will stop for a short rest and will be rewarded with the most magnificent sunrise you are ever likely to see (weather permitting). From Stella Point, you may encounter snow all they way on your 1-hour ascent to the summit. At Uhuru Peak, you have reached the highest point on Mount Kilimanjaro and the continent of Africa. Faster hikers will see the sunrise from the summit.
From the summit, we now make our descent continuing straight down to the Mweka Hut camp site, stopping at Barafu for lunch. You will want gaiters and trekking poles for the loose gravel going down. Mweka Camp is situated in the upper forest and mist or rain can be expected in the late afternoon. Later in the evening, we enjoy our last dinner on the mountain and a well-earned sleep.
DAY 7
•	Mweka Camp to Moshi
•	Elevation (ft): 10,000ft to 5,400ft
•	Distance: 10 km
•	Hiking Time: 3-4 hours
•	Habitat: Rain Forest
After breakfast, we continue the descent down to the Mweka Park Gate to receive your summit certificates. At lower elevations, it can be wet and muddy. Gaiters and trekking poles will help. Shorts and t-shirts will probably be plenty to wear (keep rain gear and warmer clothing handy).
From the gate, you continue another hour to Mweka Village. A vehicle will meet you at Mweka village to drive you back to hotel in Moshi.

                                      Do you accept clients from all countries?
Yes. We are based out of the USA and primarily our clients are from the USA. However, a significant number of our clients are from Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. We have led climbers from all over the world, including Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Kenya, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, China, Japan and more.

What is included in your prices?
Our prices include hotel accommodations before and after the climb, transportation from the hotel to the trail and back, all park fees, and meals on the mountain. Prices do not include flights, lunch, dinner or beverages at the hotel, personal gear and equipment, or tips. Our prices are listed in US Dollars.
What routes do you offer for group climbs?
We have group climbs on the 9 day Northern Circuit, 8 day Lemosho route, 7 day Rongai route, and 7 day Machame route. We specialize in Lemosho so most of our group climbs are on this route.

What routes do you offer for private climbs?
We can arrange private climbs on 10 day Northern Circuit/Crater Camp, 9 day Lemosho/Crater Camp, 9 day Northern Circuit, 7-8 day Lemosho route, 7-8 day Shira route, 6-7 day Rongai route, 6-7 day Machame route, 6- 7 day Umbwe route, 5-6 day Marangu route, and 4 day Mount Meru.
What is the difference between a group climb and private climb?
With a group climb, you will be in a party of up to 16 climbers who have booked with us separately (strangers). Group climbs are scheduled for set dates on set routes. In a private climb, you will be in a party of people you specifically booked with (friends, family, etc.). Private climbs can be scheduled on any date you choose and on any route. There is no maximum number of climbers for a private climb. The service on the mountain is exactly the same.
If I am a single climber, do I have to share a room and tent with someone else on a group climb?
We pair same sex single climbers to share a double room before and after the climb and to share a three person tent during the trek. You can get a single room and single tent for yourself by paying for a single supplement. Single supplements must be arranged at the time of booking.
Which routes do you recommend?
We recommend the 9 day Northern Circuit, 8 day Lemosho, and 7 day Rongai routes. These routes offer the best balance of high success rates, beautiful scenery and smaller crowds. 7 day Machame is a nice route as well, but has a lot of other climbers on it.

What is the best way to increase my chance of making it to the top, before the trip?

First and foremost, choose a longer route. 7 days should be the minimum and 8 or 9 days is even better. Next, put effort into your training and do it for at least two months, incorporating some long hikes if possible. Third, assemble the right gear for your climb. Lastly, consider using a high altitude training system to pre-acclimatize.

What is the best way to increase my chance of making it to the top, during the trip?

Avoiding altitude sickness is key. Do this by walking slowly. Drink lots of water and eat enough food. Go on all optional acclimatization hikes. Consider taking Diamox. Also prevent other illnesses by disinfecting your hands after every time you use the bathroom and before any meals.

What gear do I need for my climb?

There is a variety of technical clothing and equipment you will need for your climb.

How much of my gear can my porter carry for me?
The weight limit is 15 kgs (33 lbs). The sleeping bag is included in the limit. Porters will carry your duffel bag in a waterproof bag.

How much should my day pack weigh?
Try to keep it under 20 lbs. In fact, try to keep all of your belongings to under 40 lbs.

How should I dress for Kilimanjaro?

You should follow the layering principle when you dress. Layering is a systematic, logical approach to wearing multiple layers of clothing. The layers you will have are: base layer, mid layer, and outer shell.

What rental gear is available?
We have sleeping bags and trekking poles available for rent. You do not have to reserve them. You can acquire your rentals and pay for them at the trip briefing. If you need other gear, our staff can take you to independently owned shops to purchase or rent gear. However, we are not responsible for the quality of the gear you obtain at these shops. We provide foam sleeping mats for all climbers.

When is the best time to climb Kilimanjaro?

Kilimanjaro is best climbed when the weather is dry. There are two rainy seasons in Tanzania. The long rainy season is from mid-March to early June. The short rainy season is from November to early December. Therefore the best times to climb Kilimanajro are mid-December to early-March, and mid-June to end of October.

If I climb during the dry season, do I need rain gear?
Definitely. It can rain and snow all year round. The base of the mountain is in the rainforest. A quality waterproof jacket and pants is an absolute must.

How cold does it get on the mountain?
In general, expect to sleep in temperatures as low as 20F and to hike in temperatures as low as -20F. It can be even colder. Be prepared.

What kind of food is prepared on the mountain?

We serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, which consist of western style meals. Read more here.

Can you cater to special diets?
We can accommodate vegetarian and vegan diets. For more specific requirements, we will try our best but please contact us to discuss.

How do I use the bathroom on the mountain?
At each campsite, we set up a private toilet tent, which contains a plastic toilet. Each campsite also has public "long drop" toilets. If you need to use the bathroom on the trail, find a spot behind a tree or rock. We recommend bringing pee bottles so that you do not have to leave your tent multiple times during the night to urinate.

How do I shower on the mountain?
You don't. You can use wet wipes if you like to towel off. We also provide wash bins with soap for you to wash your hands and face.

What safety measures are taken by the staff?
Our guides are highly experienced to manage altitude sickness, which is the biggest obstacle on the mountain. They are certified Wilderness First Responders. They conduct twice daily health checks to measure your oxygen saturation and pulse. A rescue plan is in place in the event of an emergency. Bottled oxygen, a portable stretcher, and a first aid kit is carried on every climb.

What happens if someone in my group needs to descend? Does the entire party also have to descend?
No. We bring multiple guides on every climb so that when a climber needs to descend, it does not affect the rest of the party.

If I have to descend early, are the additional nights at the hotel covered?
Additional hotel stays are not covered and must be paid in country.

What do I need to enter Tanzania?

You will need a passport that is valid for at least six more months. You will also need a flight card which you will receive on the plane. Finally you need a Tanzanian visa.

Where do I fly into?
Our climbs begin and end in Moshi. Moshi is about 25 miles from Kilimanjaro National Airport (JRO). You should fly into Kilimanjaro National Airport and we can arrange for pick up.

Do you offer group safaris?
Unfortunately, we do not. With so many different safari options, it is difficult to put together groups who want to travel on the same itinerary on the same dates. Therefore we only offer private safaris.

What gear do I need for the safari?
The only additional item you need for the safari is perhaps binoculars. Other than that, the clothing you have for your climb is sufficient
